You curl up together and rest your weary peepers.
Never has such calmness been around you, such serenity.
The chamber closes behind you and the room chills.
Ice begins to coat the both of you and your breathing slows.
You do not mind this at all, for you have found a friend.

Accept your fate.
END
Retry.
