As you reach for the grains of gravel, you feel an odd presence.
Everything has turned a bluish gray, and the clouds seem to be rapidly shifting.
Looking to the eyes of the slugcat, a golden gaze stares back in return.
They lips do not move, but you hear a voice nonetheless.
"Fall" It boomingly announces.
You hear a clattering of chains, and you fall deep into a slumber, never to wake again.
