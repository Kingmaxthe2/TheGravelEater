You take a generous bite of one of the pebbles, forgetting that it is inedible to you.
Your teeth chip and break as you chew in the indigestable stone.
"Here, i have something to wash that down." The slugcat claims.
They hand you a metallic cylinder with liquid inside.
"It's a drink my dad made for the aincents. He calls it 'Five Pebbsi'"
You take a swig without hesitation and the golden liquid immediatly begins to burn your insides.
Your vision gets fuzzy and you may be dying, but at least it was delicious!
