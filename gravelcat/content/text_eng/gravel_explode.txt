The slugcat spasms uncontrollably and has a major coughing fit to say the least.
There's a loud and abrubt BOOM, you are flung against the wall with bits of slugcat and gravel smeared on you and the surrounding area.
You feel burns from the cyan fluid, but not for long as the damage from the explosion is too great, and you fade to black.
