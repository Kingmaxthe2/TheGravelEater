You attempt to bound the towering beast of a sediment.
As you pounce to hurdle the obstacle, the height was too great!
The hard surface collides with your gut, depleting you of air.
The observing slugcat aknowledges your endeavor and sighs with plumes of cyan breath.
They perform a manuever you thought impossible:
Utilizing their firey breath as propulsion they somehow flipped themselves and with their face towards the ground.
With a great POW they reach the peak of the great mineral conglomeration.
They beam stunningly from the highest reach.

"so kewl!"
