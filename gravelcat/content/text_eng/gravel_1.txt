Suddenly, you hear a sharp coughing sound from behind you.
You turn around just in time to see a slugcat chowing down on a fistful of rocks and gravel.
Their rough skin has the coloration of oxidized copper.
They are covered from ear to tail in dirt and soot and has visible chemical burns on their mouth.
