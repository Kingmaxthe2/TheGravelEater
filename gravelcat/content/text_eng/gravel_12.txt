All at once, the insanity halts.
You find yourself in a room with semi-organic tendrils shoot small arcs of electricity between themselves.
The slugcat you met sits inside an open chamber with ice lining the sides.
"I don't feel it anymore, the constant burning pain or the swells from growing tissue."
They seem content with staying right where they are.
