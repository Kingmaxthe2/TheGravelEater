As the brilliant slugcat begins their decent they stub their toe on an outcrop of the stone.
They trip and proceed into a freefall.
"ill catch u!" You call out arms at the ready.
You were not prepared for the absolute mass that came upon you.

You felt many bones shatter on impact, the slugcat however, seems unfased.
They started to speak but the ringing in your ears muffled it.
And soon, the ringing ceases.
